# Cosmic String Emulator

`Cosmic String Emulator` is a tool for creating emulations of cosmic string maps with similar statistics to (== insert reference to cosmic string simulations ==) based on the works in Price et al. 2022 (in prep.). It uses wavelet phase harmonics to calculate scattering coefficients of the simulations. These coefficients can then be used to synthesize new realisations which have similar statistics to the original simulations. 

# Quick install (in prep.)
You can install `CosmicStringEmulator` using PyPi by running 
```bash
pip install (== insert package name here ==)
```

# Install from source
Alternative you can install the code from source by cloning and installing manually:

```
git clone https://github.com/astro-informatics/cosmic_string_emulator.git
cd cosmic_string_emulator
bash build_cosmic_string_emulator.sh
```
